Node Version Audit is a convenience tool to easily check a given Node.js version against a regularly updated
list of CVE exploits, new releases, and end of life dates.

**Node Version Audit is not:** exploit detection/mitigation, vendor-specific version tracking, a replacement for
staying informed on Node.js releases and security exploits.

## Features:
* List known CVEs for a given version of Node.js
* Check either the runtime version of Node.js, or a supplied version
* Display end-of-life dates for a given version of Node.js
* Display new releases for a given version of Node.js with configurable specificity (latest/minor/patch)
    * Patch: 16.13.0 -> 16.13.2
    * Minor: 16.13.0 -> 16.14.2
    * Latest: 16.13.0 -> 17.9.0
* Rules automatically updated daily. Information is sourced directly from php.net - you'll never be waiting on someone like me to merge a pull request before getting the latest patch information.
* Multiple interfaces: CLI (via NPM), Docker, direct code import
* Easily scriptable for use with CI/CD workflows. All Docker/CLI outputs are in JSON format to be consumed with your favorite tools - such as [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
* Configurable exit conditions. Use CLI flags like `--fail-security` to set a failure exit code if the given version of Node.js has a known CVE or is no longer supported.
* Zero dependencies

## Example:

    npx node-version-audit@latest --version=16.14.1
    {
        "auditVersion": "16.14.1",
        "hasVulnerabilities": true,
        "hasSupport": true,
        "supportType": "active",
        "isLatestPatchVersion": false,
        "isLatestMinorVersion": false,
        "isLatestVersion": false,
        "latestPatchVersion": "16.14.2",
        "latestMinorVersion": "16.14.2",
        "latestVersion": "17.9.0",
        "activeSupportEndDate": "2022-10-18T00:00:00.000Z",

        "rulesLastUpdatedDate": "2022-04-13T02:37:54.081Z",
        "vulnerabilities": {
            "CVE-2022-778": {
                "id": "CVE-2022-778",
                "baseScore": 7.5,
                "publishedDate": "2022-03-15T17:15:00.000Z",

                "description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc)."
            }
        }
    }

## Usage

### CLI

Running directly with npx is the preferred and easiest way to use Node Version Audit.

Execute the script, checking the run-time version of Node.js:

    npx node-version-audit@latest

Produce an exit code if any CVEs are found or support has ended

    npx node-version-audit@latest --fail-security

### Docker

Prefer Docker? Not a problem. It is just as easy to run using Docker:

Check a specific version of Node.js using Docker:

    docker run --rm -t lightswitch05/node-version-audit:latest --version=17.9.0

Check the host's Node.js version using Docker:

    docker run --rm -t lightswitch05/node-version-audit:latest --version=$(node -e "console.log(process.versions.node)")

Run behind an HTTPS proxy (for use on restricted networks). Requires a volume mount of a directory with your trusted cert (with .crt extension) - see [update-ca-certificates](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/ca-certificates/update-ca-certificates.8.en.html) for more details.

    docker run --rm -t -e https_proxy='https://your.proxy.server:port/' --volume /full/path/to/trusted/certs/directory:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates lightswitch05/node-version-audit:latest --version=17.9.0

### Direct Invocation

Want to integrate with Node Version Audit? That is certainly possible. A word caution, this is a very early release. I do not have any plans for breaking changes, but I am also not committed to keeping the interface code as-is if there are new features to implement. Docker/CLI/JSON is certainly the preferred over direct invocation.

    const { NodeVersionAudit } = require('node-version-audit/lib/NodeVersionAudit');

    const nodeVersionAudit = new NodeVersionAudit('17.8.0', true);
    const auditResults = await nodeVersionAudit.getAllAuditResults();
    auditResults.supportEndDate; //-> 2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z
    auditResults.hasVulnerabilities(); //-> true

### JSON Rules

The data used to drive Node Version Audit is automatically updated on a regular basis and is hosted on GitHub pages. This is the real meat-and-potatoes of Node Version Audit, and you can consume it directly for use in other tools. If you choose to do this, please respect the project license by giving proper attribution notices. Also, I ask any implementations to read the lastUpdatedDate and fail if it has become out of date (2+ weeks). This should not happen since it is automatically updatedâ€¦ but we all know how fragile software is.

Get the latest Node.js 17 release version directly from the rules using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

    curl -s https://www.github.developerdan.com/node-version-audit/rules-v1.json | jq '.latestVersions["17"]'

### Options

    usage: node-version-audit	[--help] [--version=NODE_VERSION]
                    [--fail-security] [--fail-support]
                    [--fail-patch] [--fail-latest]
                    [--no-update] [--silent]
                    [--v]
    optional arguments:
    --help				show this help message and exit.
    --version			set the Node Version to run against. Defaults to the runtime version. This is required when running with docker.
    --fail-security			generate a 10 exit code if any CVEs are found, or security support has ended.
    --fail-support			generate a 20 exit code if the version of Node no longer gets active (bug) support.
    --fail-patch			generate a 30 exit code if there is a newer patch-level release.
    --fail-minor			generate a 40 exit code if there is a newer minor-level release.
    --fail-latest			generate a 50 exit code if there is a newer release.
    --no-update			do not download the latest rules. NOT RECOMMENDED!
    --silent			do not write any error messages to STDERR.
    --v				Set verbosity. v=warnings, vv=info, vvv=debug. Default is error. All logging writes to STDERR.

## Project Goals:

* Always use update-to-date information and fail if it becomes too stale. Since this tool is designed to help its users stay informed, it must in turn fail if it becomes outdated.
* Fail if the requested information is unavailable. ex. auditing an unknown version of Node.js like 12.50.0, or 0.9.0. Again, since this tool is designed to help its users stay informed, it must in turn fail if the requested information is unavailable.
* Work in both open and closed networks (as long as the tool is up-to-date).
* Minimal footprint and dependencies (no runtime dependencies).
* Runtime support for the oldest supported version of Node.js. If you are using this tool with an unsupported version of Node.js, then you already have all the answers that this tool can give you: Yes, you have vulnerabilities and are out of date. Of course that is just for the run-time, it is still the goal of this project to supply information about any reasonable version of Node.js.
